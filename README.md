# Sales_Predictions_DataScienceProject

This project explored outlet sales and a slew of variables that impact outlet sales (e.g., MRP, outlet size, item types).
Initial data exploration not only showed the characteristics of many of these features (ranges, averages, etc.), but also that there is a notable difference in outlet sales based on some of these factors (e.g., outlet size)
Looking at 4 different models (OLS Regression, Decision Trees, Bagged Trees, Random Forest), it appeared that Random Forests provided the degree of explainability (R2 of 60% in the test data) achieved with 5 max depth and n-estimators of 200.
